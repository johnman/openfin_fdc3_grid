# FDC3 Grid Example

This is an example repo. It contains a publisher app that publishes an instrument to the fdc3 message bus and a listener app that receives the instrument and adds it as a row to the listener grid.

The applications import the fdc3 support by using a script tag and enabling the service in the config file.
